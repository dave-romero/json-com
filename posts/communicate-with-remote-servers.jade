p When you need to send data back and forth with a RESTful webservice or other backend server, you need a way to structure the data that you send and receive.
p In a previous age, ajax requests would send key-value pairs to webservices using query parameters or as form-encoded values in the body of a POST request.
p However, this gets really bulky when you need to send arrays and nested objects.  Imagine trying to transmit these data via URL parameters:
pre.
  {
    "subscribe": [
      "peter",
      "henrietta",
      "xavier"
    ]
  }
p The resulting URL might look something like this:
  br
  http://www.example.com/services/subscribe?subscribe[]=peter&subscribe[]=henrietta&subscribe[]=xavier
  br
  Yuck.
p However, ajax requests are perfectly capable of sending JSON-encoded payloads within the body of a POST request, which is much cleaner.  Here is an example of how to send a JSON-encoded POST body with the jQuery library:
pre.
  $.ajax({
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "data": '{"subscribe": ["peter", "henrietta", "xavier"]}',
    ...
  });
p Note that you have to send the JSON object as a string, since otherwise jQuery will invoke the object’s toString() method, and you’ll end up sending “[object Object]”, which is not particularly helpful!
p Just about every server-side language has a JSON library, so decoding the incoming request payload on the server side is trivial.  Here are some resources for common server-side languages:
ul
  li C#
  li Java
  li PHP
  li Python
  li Ruby
p Don’t forget to have the remote service send back its response in JSON, too!
